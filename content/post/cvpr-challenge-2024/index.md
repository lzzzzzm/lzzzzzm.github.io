## Task Description

The representation of 3D bounding boxes is not enough to describe general objects (obstacles). Instead, inspired by concepts in robotics, we perform general object detection via an occupancy representation to cover more irregularly shaped (e.g., protruding) objects. The goal of this task is to predict the 3D occupancy of the complete scene and the flow of the foreground objects given the input image from six cameras.
